# Cursed_Kingdom
A 2D amateur game, created to pratice habilities with Python, using the library Pygame. 
Bugs:
Problems with the fps, some of the sprites have some lag during the execution;
The projectiles are not printed correctly;
The life recover is not right, the life added is bigger than the expected;
The progress saving solution is not working well, so the game is never saved (need to alter to MySQL);
The .exe program is interpreted as a virus in other computers so it can't run;
The images need to have a special location to be loaded;
Still searching for more tests and trying to find more bugs.
